# ðŸ“š Bookly â€” FastAPI CRUD Practice Project

This is a learning project built while following the [**FastAPI Beyond CRUD**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEt8Tae2spYnHy378vMlPH--87cfeh33P) YouTube tutorial series by **Ssali Jonathan**.

The goal is to practice core FastAPI concepts beyond the basics â€” including:
- Creating and managing API routes with `APIRouter`
- Organizing a modular project structure
- Using Pydantic for data validation and serialization
- Connecting to a PostgreSQL database (hosted on [Neon](https://neon.tech/))
- Implementing full CRUD operations for a list of books

> ðŸ”§ This project is strictly for learning purposes and will evolve as I work through each part of the tutorial.
